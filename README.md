# Import and read a CSV file using Gin and RabbitMQ
This project is a sandbox to test the power of Go.

I wish I could compare performances between a Go and a PHP application.

# Installation
## Docker
Run command ```docker-compose up --build```

## Install Air to build through the...air
```go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest```

This tool watches files editions, then rebuild your Go application.
